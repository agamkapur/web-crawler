# Problem Statement

Create a Python app that can be run from the command line that will accept a base URL to crawl the site. For each page it finds, the script will print the URL of the page and all the URLs it finds on that page. The crawler will only process that single domain and not crawl URLs pointing to other domains or subdomains. Please employ patterns that will allow your crawler to run as quickly as possible, making full use any patterns that might boost the speed of the task, whilst not sacrificing accuracy and compute resources. Do not use tools like Scrapy or Playwright. You may use libraries for other purposes such as making HTTP requests, parsing HTML and other similar tasks.
